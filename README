Goals:

* a DSL for describing morphology in human languages
* compact and clear notation, readable by humans
* variant forms should be modeled (national variations, spelling reforms)
* a tool should be able to generate all forms
* Python as development language
* output should be checked against existing open source data sets
* a classic conjugation website is one output
* a way to drive some kind of e-reader plugin that allows verb forms to be analysed
* initial targets Spanish, French, Latin
* later other language families

Initial sketch example grammar is just some ideas, end result could be completely different...
